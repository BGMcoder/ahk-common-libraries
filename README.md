Common Reusable Libraries

I like to reuse the same functions in all my autohotkey projects, so I put them all into class libraries, that way, if I improve a function it will be improved in all my projects.

core.ahk is my main script, and most if not all of the others will reference it.  If you use any of these libraries, watch out that you also download any of its inclusion dependencies.
